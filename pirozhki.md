Directions
==========

1. In a skillet heat half the **butter**, add the **meat** and cook until
   brown. Remove the meat from the pan and grind (again) with the stand
   mixer, using the finest grind setting.

2. Add the **water or broth** to the skillet and heat while scraping loose
   the browned particles.

3. In a separate skillet heat the remaining **butter**, add the **onions**
   and cook until brown. Stir in the **flour**. Add the liquid from the
   first skillet and cook, stirring, until thick. Mix **all ingredients**
   and season to taste.

4. Roll **dough** to less than .25 inch thickness, in 3"x3" or 4"x4" sheets.
   Place a rounded teaspoon of meat filling in the center, fold the sides
   of the dough over the filling and roll into a long shape with tapering
   ends and a plump center. Place on a greased baking sheet, cover and let
   stand until the dough is light, about 20 minutes.

5. Preheat the oven to 425F.

6. Brush the tops with egg yolk mixture (**egg yolk**, **water**) and bake at
   425F for 15 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 400F and bake until
   brown, about 20 minutes longer.
