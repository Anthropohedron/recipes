1. Put the **diced tomatoes** (with their liquid) in a large stewpot on a
   low flame. Add **kidney beans**, **chili powder**, **cumin**,
   **paprika**, and **garlic**.

2. Chop the onion and bell pepper. Add the **onion** to the pot.

3. Brown the sausage. Add the **sausage** to the pot, including some of the
   grease (particularly from the *hot* Italian sausage). Add **cinnamon**,
   **pepper**, **wine**, and **vinegar**.

4. Simmer for at least 4 hours, stirring from time to time. Add the **bell
