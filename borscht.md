For Best Results
================

The recipe scales up (double, triple, etc.) easily and there's room for
adjustment of ingredient proportions, but make sure to keep the salt,
water, and cabbage proportions the same.

Ingredients Prep
----------------

* Cut the beef into bite-sized chunks
* Grate the beets with a food processor to get "strings"
* Chop/shred the cabbage with a knife, not a food processor
* Chop/mince the green pepper at least as finely as the onion

When Simmering
--------------

* Avoid boiling for more than just a moment at the start
* Stir occasionally, but do not attempt to season while simmering
