Directions
==========

Put the diced tomatoes in a large stewpot on a low flame. Add kidney beans,
garlic, chili powder, and cumin.

Chop the onion and bell pepper. Brown the sausage. Add the sausage to the
pot, including some of the grease (particularly from the hot Italian
sausage). Add cinnamon, pepper, wine, and vinegar.

Simmer for at least 4 hours, mixing from time to time. Add the onion, bell
pepper, chick peas, and corn any time before the last hour of simmering;
timing will affect how firm they are.

Even better the next day. Can be frozen indefinitely. Serve hot with
shredded cheddar and sour cream.
